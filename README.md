# A little bit about Funiform

## Hobby
At this stage, the *Gundam model kit building* is what I would like to spend most of my time when I'm free.
Feel free to click this *[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmD1yYqP6k&ab_channel=AdamSavage%E2%80%99sTested)* to explore more on the experience of building a Gundam model kit.

### Grade (Scale) of the model kit
There are many grades or scales for model kits based on their difficulty in building or the size of the model kits. For instance, 1. high grade(1/144), 2. master grade(1/100), 3. perfect grade(1/60).

### The tools you need to have before building a model kit
**Remember! you can't just pull the parts off from the runner with your fingers**
**The tools you need!**
* a Hobby cutter or a nipper
* an X-Acto knife
* a form of sandpaper
The first bullet point is used to cut the parts from the runners, and the last two bullet points are used to clean up the surface after cutting the parts from the runners.
